## Project Overview and Task Insights
In this project, I'm part of Quantiumâ€™s retail analytics team. This virtual experience program involves analysing chip purchases at supermarkets. The aim of this project was to evaluate different customers' purchasing behaviours and the performance of trial stores with a new layout to provide insights of customer preferences to the client and a recommendation of whether the trial has been successful.

I was assigned 3 tasks in this project:

- Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics

- Task 2: Experimentation and uplift testing

- Task 3: Analytics and commercial application

I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze and Share

# Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics

Files: QVI_Task1.ipynb, utilize files: QVI_purchase_behaviour.csv and QVI_transaction_data.xlsx

Data analysis to understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours:

- LIFESTAGE: Customer attribute that identifies whether a customer has a family or not and what point in life they are at

- PREMIUM_CUSTOMER: Customer segmentation used to differentiate shoppers by the price point of products they buy and the types of products they buy. It is used to identify whether customers may spend more for quality or brand or whether they will purchase the cheapest options.
